###These are scripts currently used in the Palumbi lab for transcriptome assembly and analysis.

###See [Palumbi Lab's Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics] (http://sfg.stanford.edu) for helpful background information. Warning: scripts referred to in the SFG manual are outdated and difficult to use. 

###Refer to Guide\_to\_scripts.md in docs for an easy to follow pipeline. This doc is currently in progress and being updated regularly.
